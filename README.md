# KalmanFilter
The Kalman Filter algorithm implemented in Matlab environment
Firstly it is needed to plot the graph of state_space_equation program that is the model of a parabolic motion.
Then the result should be copied to the txt file called camera_meas_xyz. In the KF program, to the data will be added measurement noise
and disturbances. The Kalman Filer will find the optimal solution and point the the best position in x, y, z dimmensions.
